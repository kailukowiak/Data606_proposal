```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


### Data Preparation

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)
```

```{r  loading, cache=TRUE,  message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
train <- fread("/Users/kailukowiak/Data606_Proposal/Zillow/train_2016.csv")
properties <- fread("/Users/kailukowiak/Data606_Proposal/Zillow/properties_2016.csv")
```


### Research question 

**You should phrase your research question in a way that matches up with the scope of inference your dataset allows for.**

**Can baisic statistical models predict housing prices better than baisic markers like mean price for an area or inflation adjusted previous price?**


### Cases 

**What are the cases, and how many are there?**


### Data collection 

**Describe the method of data collection.**

Data collection was easy since the datasets were posted on kaggle.
Files can be dowloaded here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/zillow-prize-1/data


### Type of study 

**What type of study is this (observational/experiment)?**

This is an observational study based on previous housing prices and atributes. 

### Data Source 

**If you collected the data, state self-collected. If not, provide a citation/link.**

https://www.kaggle.com/c/zillow-prize-1/data

### Response 

**What is the response variable, and what type is it (numerical/categorical)?**

The response variable in numeric (log error or housing price error).

### Explanatory 

**What is the explanatory variable, and what type is it (numerical/categorival)?**

There are a mix of numeric and catigorical variables (nothing OLS can't handle)

### Relevant summary statistics 

**Provide summary statistics relevant to your research question. For example, if youâ€™re comparing means across groups provide means, SDs, sample sizes of each group. This step requires the use of R, hence a code chunk is provided below. Insert more code chunks as needed.**

```{r summarystats}
qplot(logerror, data =  train, bins = 400) + 
  ylab("Count") + 
  ggtitle("Counts of log error",subtitle = "For the Train Dataset") + 
  coord_cartesian(x = c(-0.5,0.5)) +
  theme_economist()
```


```{r}
glimpse(properties)
```

There are a lot of NAs.
```{r}
naVals <- properties %>% 
  summarise_all(funs(sum(is.na(.))/n())) %>% 
  gather(key = "Variable", value = "missingPercent")

```

```{r naChart, fig.width=6, fig.height=9}
naVals %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder( Variable, missingPercent), y = missingPercent)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  ylim(0,1) +
  ggtitle("Percentage of Non- Missing Values") +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_economist()


```
