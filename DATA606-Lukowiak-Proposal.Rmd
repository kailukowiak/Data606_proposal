```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


### Data Preparation

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)
library(tibble)
library(knitr)
library(corrr)
```

```{r  loading, cache=TRUE,  message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
test <- as.tibble(fread("/Users/kailukowiak/Data606_Proposal/test.csv", na.strings = c("-1","-1.0")))
train <- as.tibble(fread("/Users/kailukowiak/Data606_Proposal/train.csv", na.strings = c("-1","-1.0")))
head(test) 
head(train)
```

```{r}
glimpse(train)
```


### Research question 

**You should phrase your research question in a way that matches up with the scope of inference your dataset allows for.**

**Can simple statistical and ML models predict accidents better than baisic markers like age adgusted rates or the base line rate?**


### Cases 

**What are the cases, and how many are there?**

The cases are individual people who bought insurance.

```{r}
x = nrow(train) + nrow(test)
```

There are: `r x` cases.

### Data collection

**Describe the method of data collection.**

Data collection was easy since the data sets were posted on kaggle.
Files can be downloaded here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/porto-seguro-safe-driver-prediction/data

### Type of study 

**What type of study is this (observational/experiment)?**

This is an observational study based on insurance claims and people's attributes. 

### Data Source 

**If you collected the data, state self-collected. If not, provide a citation/link.**

https://www.kaggle.com/c/porto-seguro-safe-driver-prediction/data


### Response 

**What is the response variable, and what type is it (numerical/categorical)?**

The response variable in categorical because it takes on a value of zero and 1 if there was a claim.

### Explanatory 

**What is the explanatory variable, and what type is it (numerical/categorival)?**

There are a mix of numeric and categorical variables (nothing logistic regression / random forrests can't handle)

### Relevant summary statistics 

**Provide summary statistics relevant to your research question. For example, if youâ€™re comparing means across groups provide means, SDs, sample sizes of each group. This step requires the use of R, hence a code chunk is provided below. Insert more code chunks as needed.**

```{r}
y = 1
```

There are a lot of NAs.
```{r}
train %>% 
  select(target) %>% 
  group_by(target) %>% 
  summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  ggplot( aes(x = target, y = n))+
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', fill = 'light blue') +
  ggtitle("Count of Claims vs No Claims") +
  xlab('Claim or No Claim') + 
  ylab('Count')
  
```

```{r}
naVals <- test %>%  
  select(which(colMeans(is.na(.)) > 0)) %>% 
  summarise_all(funs(sum(is.na(.))/n())) %>%
  gather(key = "Variable", value = "missingPercent")

```


```{r}
ggplot(naVals, aes(x = reorder( Variable, missingPercent), y = missingPercent)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = 'light blue') +
  ylim(0,1) +
  ggtitle("Percentage of Non- Missing Values") +
  coord_flip() 
```

We can see that most of ```ps_car_03_cat``` and ```ps_car_05_cat``` is missing. Other than that, most variables contain few if any NAs.

```{r}
corrDF <- train %>% 
  correlate() %>% 
  focus(target)
```

```{r fig.height=9, fig.width=7}
ggplot(corrDF, aes(x =reorder(rowname, abs(target)), y = target)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', fill = 'light blue') +
  coord_flip()+
  ylab('Variable')+
  xlab('Correlation with Target')+
  ggtitle('Correlation of the Dependant Variable with all Other Variables')
```


Because the correlation values are so low, we will probably have to equalize the success and failure rates so that success doesn't dominate the results.
